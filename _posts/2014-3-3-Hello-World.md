My parents believed that I'd be born male. With this in mind, they wanted to name me "Thai", in reference to the founding emperor of the [LÃª Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%AA_dynasty). They hoped that the name would grant me inner strength and fortitude. Upon introduction to my lack of male genitals, though, they elected to feminize their originally chosen name by tacking on "An", which means "peace" or "quiet". Together, "Thai An" means something in the vein of "very peaceful/quiet/safe".

I've always hated "Thai An"; can't help but feel like it's a consolation prize name. So, around age 12, I cast off my first name's caboose and started to refer to myself as "Thai". Its "snappy" and "cool" vibes better captured me.

Sometime in high school, I realized I liked going by "Thai" better than by "Thai An" not because it felt cooler but rather because it was a more masculine name. With this realization came another: I never really felt "like a girl". To this day, I couldn't tell you what that means if I tried. I don't not feel like a girl because I don't like to shop for clothing nor because I don't like to put on make-up. (Which, of course, are not necessary inclinations for a girl to possess, nor necessary inclinations for a boy to avoid.) I don't not feel like a girl because I... don't.

I've held off for a long while about discussing my gender identity because I don't really "get" gender identity. Do I (do people?) identify as more male because I more associate myself with traits promoted by testosterone? What are those traits, though? Are they traits naturally promoted by testosterone, or are they traits we've ascribed to be "male" simply due to how social and cultural norms have supprsesed women? (Think how some ascribe sci/tech ability to be a more male feature.) Continuing along this line of thinking...

Do I identify as more male because I'm a Type A who shies from identifying as female because of current social and cultural norms and conditions for women? ...

Bar Heavy Science-ing (intense medical options such as surgery or hormone treatment), there's not much to be done about your birth sex. 

If I were to try to present myself as male tomorrow, my mezzo-soprano voice and short stature alone would, at best, raise eyebrows and induce a couple of double-takes. Yeah, yeah, eyebrow raises and double-takes aren't going to kill me, but they're not pleasant, either. And, again, that's the best case scenario in today's world. In a worse situation, my career and well-being could be made at-risk.
